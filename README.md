The study project aims to explore the implementation and practical application of GitLab CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) within a controlled environment, utilizing an Ubuntu Server Virtual Machine (VM). The primary objective of this project is to enhance understanding of DevOps practices through hands-on experience in automating the development, testing, and deployment processes. The initial phase includes configuring an Ubuntu Server VM that serves as the CI/CD host. This VM is equipped with GitLab Runner, a key component that enables the execution of jobs defined in the CI/CD pipeline. The environment is prepared to handle specific Linux networking tasks necessary for deployment to another VM.

A comprehensive pipeline created using a .gitlab-ci.yml configuration file. This file defines various stages of the pipeline, including:

  - Code Style Tests: Automated code style checks will be performed to ensure that the code adheres to defined style guidelines. This phase will utilize linters and formatters suitable for the programming languages being used, thereby promoting code quality and consistency.
  - Integration Tests: Following the code style validation, integration tests will be conducted to verify the interactions between different components of the application. This will ensure that all parts of the system function together as expected, identifying any potential issues before deployment.
  - Upon successful completion of the tests, the project will be automatically deployed to a secondary virtual machine. This deployment process will leverage knowledge of Linux networking principles to facilitate seamless communication between the source VM (hosting the CI/CD pipeline) and the target VM (where the application will be deployed). The deployment will be executed in a manner that minimizes downtime and ensures that the application is delivered in a stable state.
